          Hey, I'm <span class="text-purple-700 font-bold">David</span>. I've
          been leading tech departments, building scalable systems, and managing
          infrastructure teams for
          <span class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold">over 25 years</span>. I'm
          a technologist with a passion for
          <span class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold"
            >organizational design</span

          <span class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold">cloud architecture</span>,
          and
          <span class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold">distributed systems</span
          >. I love solving complex problems and making technology work for
          people, not the other way around.

        <p>
          I've spent a big chunk of my career
          <span class="font-semibold"
            >leading teams and scaling systems to handle massive growth</span
          >. At
          <a
            href="https://www.spotify.com/"
            class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-800 underline"
            >Spotify</a
          >, I started the Site Reliability Engineering department and grew it
          from 5 people to hundreds. I led the migration of
          <span class="font-semibold">15,000+ physical servers</span> to
          <a
            href="https://cloud.google.com/"
            class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-800 underline"
            >Google Cloud</a
          >, which was a huge milestone for the company. I'm all about making
          systems scalable, reliable, and future-proof.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also been leading
          <span class="font-semibold">technical due diligence processes</span>,
          during acquisitions and helping
          <a
            href="https://www.secways.com/"
            class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-800 underline"
            >Secways</a
          >
          assessing their investments. Whether it's reviewing vendors,
          evaluating tech stacks, or integrating new companies, I've got the
          experience to make sure everything aligns with the bigger picture.
          I've been deeply involved in technological transformations, like
          preparing Spotify's tech stack to go public, ensuring compliance, and
          meeting all the new requirements without sacrificing productivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Scalability and architecture</span>
          are my bread and butter. I've worked on projects that process
          <span class="font-semibold">billions of events daily</span>, and I've
          designed systems to handle redundancy and recovery in case of major
          cloud incidents. My goal is always to balance performance, security,
          and developer productivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also got a strong
          <span class="font-semibold">entrepreneurial streak</span>. I founded
          and ran my own ISP for over 7 years, where I wore many hats: technical
          lead, managing director, and systems architect. More recently, I've
          been working with VCs, advising on tech investments and overseeing the
          technology stack across portfolios.
          <span class="font-semibold"
            >Building things from the ground up and helping others scale their
            ideas</span
          >
          is something I truly enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've always believed in
          <span class="font-semibold"
            >mentoring the next generation of tech leaders</span
          >. I mentor emerging leaders and help transform teams into
          product-oriented organizations. Leadership isn't just about managing
          people—it's about empowering them to do their best work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also a co-host of two podcasts:
          <a

            >Entre Dev y Ops</a
          >. I love sharing knowledge and discussing the latest in software
          engineering and tech trends.
